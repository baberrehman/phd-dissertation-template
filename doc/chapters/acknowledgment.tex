I have no words to show the gratitude towards my
advisor Dr. Bruno C. d. S. Oliveira and I think it 
certainly cannot be expressed in words.
The study of programming languages
and specifically the type systems was an alien universe 
for me before starting the PhD.
I have programmed in a few programming languages but never
really thought about the theoretical complexity involved
behind the design of a sound programming language.
All credits due to Bruno's guidance which made me able to
learn a glimpse of this once an alien universe.
I am grateful to Bruno for his
guidance and support throughout my doctoral studies.
%He possesses the total qualities of an ideal supervisor.
% How patiently he motivated
% me when I was at the brink of giving up!

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude towards the examiners,
reviewers, and the referees. The comments, suggestions,
and recommendations from Prof. Sukyoung Ryu, Dr. H.F. Ting, Dr. Chenshu Wu,
Dr. Sergio D.N. Lourenco, Dr. Lionel Parreaux, Dr. Marco Campion,
Dr. Khurram Shahzad, and Dr. Imran Farid Khan have been imperative.

Afterwards, the support from the Snow (Xuejing Huang) has
been incredible. Thank you for showing me a way out when I was
lost in in my research.
%I often call her my mini-supervisor.
Moving on, the insightful philosophical
discussions with Alvin (Mingqi Xue) have been inspiring.
This has been a great pleasure for me to meet
with Alvin over a meal and discuss various social topics.
Perhaps the homo sapiens may learn from their recurring
mistakes someday and the world would be a better place.
My sincere thanks to all of my colleagues, Xuan Bi (Jeremy),
Haoyuan Zhang, Yanlin Wang (Grace), Yanpeng Yang (Linus),
Weixin Zhang, Ningning Xie, Jinxu Zhao (Jimmy), Yaoda Zhou,
Yaozhu Sun, Wenjia Ye, Xu Xue, Chen Cui, Jinhao Tan, Shengyi Jiang,
Litao Zhou (Tony), and Han Xu.

Hong Kong blessed me with the amazing experiences and people.
I am grateful to the New College tutorial team and specifically
to Prof. CHOW Y.M. Amy for her support and guidance.
Sustainable learning from the New College would
be an integral part of my career.
%Stay sustainable!
I am thankful to the beautiful souls I
met in Hong Kong. Sharas, Sabir, Niraj, Shujahat, Huzaifa,
Mahram, Adeel, Abdullah, Feroz, Atta, Najam, Nadeem and Hassan.
%My journey in Hong Kong would have been very different otherwise.
I would like to take the opportunity and express my
gratitude to my friends and colleagues at CloudPlex PVT LTD, where I 
worked after my Bachelor's degree. Most of all, Asad Faizi 
and Haseeb Humayun, thank you for your support.
Importantly, I am grateful to Asad Faizi for showing
me around Seattle post OPLSS'19.
% My PhD is the sum total
% of all of those memories and experiences.

Being a recipient of the University Postgraduate Fellowship (UPF),
I am much obliged to the Lee Shau Kee Postgraduate Fellowship donors
for the award.
Last but not the least,
thanks to my wife, mother and siblings for their
incredible support. This would not have been possible
without your support. A supporting partner can make the
hard times easier to bear. I have felt that through thick
and thin with my adorable wife.
